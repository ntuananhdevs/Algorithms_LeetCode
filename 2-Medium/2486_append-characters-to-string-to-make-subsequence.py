# You are given two strings s and t consisting of only lowercase English letters.

# Return the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of s so that t becomes a subsequence of s.

# A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

# Example 1:
# Input: s = "coaching", t = "coding"
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Append the characters "ding" to the end of s so that s = "coachingding".
# Now, t is a subsequence of s ("coachingding").
# It can be shown that appending any 3 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.

class Solution:
    def appendCharacters(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        i, j = 0, 0
        while i < len(s) and j < len(t):
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                j += 1
            i += 1

        return len(t) - j
